## NTU EE Machine Learning

This is a set of project records in the Machine Learning class. The following is the summery of each project. Also, all project source codes are included in this repository.

### Project 1: COVID-19 Cases Prediction (Regression)
In this project, we sloved the COVID-19 Cases Prediction problem with deep neural networks (DNN). Also, we learned and tried some basic DNN training tips such as data cleaning, fine-tuning hyperparameters. Also, we were more familiar with PyTorch by doing this project.

### Project 2: Convolutional Neural Network
In this project, we learned about the basic concept of convolutional neural network (CNN) and built a CNN for food-11 image classification. In this project, what impresses me most is that complex neural networks can not get better test results. Too deep neural networks can lead to serious overfitting problems, which is very obvious in this project.

### Project 3: Generative Adversarial Network
In this project, we built a generative adversarial network (GAN) for anime face generation. In this project, I deeply realized that the training process of GAN is much more unstable than ordinary CNN. In addition, I also understood the principle and application of GAN.

### Project 4: Explainable AI (CNN)
In this project, we used several visualization methods, including lime package, salience map, smooth grad, filter explanation, and integrated gradient, to understand the focus of convolutional neural network judgment. This practice enabled us to better understand the real operation of convolutional neural networks, rather than just judging from the results.

### Project 5: Transfer Learning (Domain Adversarial Training)
In the last project, we used DANN for Domain Adverse Training. Even if the target domain was not labeled, it could still successfully train a classification model with superior performance.

### Project 6: Adversarial Attack
In this project, we used FGSM to create specific images to attack the trained convolutional neural network. Even if the image produced by FGSM was slightly different from the original image, it could effectively confuse the judgment of CNN.
